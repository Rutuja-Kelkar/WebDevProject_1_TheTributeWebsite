          <h1>Missle Man of India</h1>
          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15
            October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
            statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to
            2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
            physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
            a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
            Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
            Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development
            efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
            his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
            support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
            then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
            "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of
            education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a
            recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
            India's highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the
            Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
            from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7]
            Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the
            funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was
            buried with full state honours.[8]
